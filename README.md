# 🔗 Singly Linked List – Insertion & Deletion in Python

This program implements a **Singly Linked List** with the ability to:

- Insert nodes at the end  
- Delete a node from the **beginning**  
- Delete a node from the **end**  
- Display the entire list  

It demonstrates basic linked list operations used in Data Structures.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

A **Linked List** is made of nodes, where each node contains:

- `data` → the stored value  
- `next` → pointer to the next node  

Linked lists allow efficient insertions and deletions compared to arrays.
